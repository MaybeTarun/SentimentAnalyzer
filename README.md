# SentimentAnalyzer

It is a Python application that utilizes the Boto3 library to interact with Amazon Comprehend's sentiment analysis service. The application is built with a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter library.

Key features of this sentiment analyzer include:

Input Text Box: Users can input text or a document into a text box within the GUI.

Analyze Button: When users click the "Analyze" button, the application sends the entered text to Amazon Comprehend using Boto3 for sentiment analysis.

Result Display: The sentiment analyzer categorizes the sentiment of the input text into four categories: positive, negative, neutral, and mixed. The results are displayed on the GUI.
